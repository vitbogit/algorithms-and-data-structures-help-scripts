# Finding erros in your algorithm

Sometimes it\`s nearly impossible to find out why my algorithm doesn\`t work with testing system\`s examples, that`s why I have to create some kind of own testing system. Of course, **we should always look for mistakes in our algorithms first using our eyes**, but everyone may have their own reasons for using these scripts, and I have my reasons too.
